          <p>I'm a part designer and coder and some how a poor blogger, but trying hard in blog field to become a professional.</p>
          <p>I maintain a healthy balance between functionality and visual imapct in all my work. I believe every piece of design can be a work of art.</p>
          <p>I enjoy turning complex problems into simple.</p>
          <p>When I'm not coding or pushing pixels, you'll find me hanging out with mah friends. I want to live on Pandora with the Navi. I like to play with Transformers.</p>
